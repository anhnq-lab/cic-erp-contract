-- Migration: Fix get_units_with_stats to include collaborative unit allocations
-- Problem: Previous version only counted contracts where unit_id matched directly,
-- completely ignoring contracts where a unit participates via unit_allocations JSONB.
-- Fix: Parse unit_allocations->allocations[] and include support units with their %
